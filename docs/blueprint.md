## Style Guidelines:

- Background: Dark background (#121212) to enhance the neon accents and create a futuristic atmosphere.
- Primary Color: Electric Purple (#C06C84) to evoke digital energy and mystique.
- Accent Color: Sakura Red (#F67280) as a secondary neon to complement the purple, drawing inspiration from traditional Japanese art.
- Font Choice: Use 'Space Grotesk' (sans-serif) for headlines, creating a techno, scientific feel, and pair it with 'Inter' (sans-serif) for body text to maintain readability with a modern, neutral aesthetic. Note: currently only Google Fonts are supported.
- Implement glowing, minimalist icons in neon colors that reflect the studioâ€™s digital aesthetic.
- Adopt a layout blending brutalist minimalism with modern Japanese design, featuring stark lines, grid-based sections, and ample negative space to give a sense of controlled chaos and precision.
- Integrate smooth scrolling, fade-in effects on sections, glowing hover effects on buttons, glitch effects on interface elements, and subtle parallax scrolling on background glyphs.
